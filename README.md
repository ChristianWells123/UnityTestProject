# UnityTestProject
A Unity project containing my personal experiments with Unity. 

I spent a lot of time creating a camera control system, which you can see in `Assets/scripts/CameraController`.
Additionally, I created an Object-Oriented character system, which can handle Player-Characters and Non-Player-Characters. you can see it in `Assets/scripts/Character`.
